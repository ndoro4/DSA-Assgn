1.Memroy Allocation
In arrays memory allocation is in a contiguous block which is fixed in size.
In Linked Lists memory allocation isn't contiguous and is dynamic which means the size can grow and the nodes are allocated separately

2.Performance
In arrays the performance is of faster access.
In linked lists the performance is of slower access.

3.Insertion/Deletion Properties
In arrays insertion/deletion in the requires shifting elements which makes it costly.
In linked lists insertion/deletion could be more efficient depending on the position.
