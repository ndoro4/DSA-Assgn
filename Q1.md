1.Ignore constants
It drops coefficients and lower-order terms
eg. O(2n)->O(n).
    O(n+5)->O(n).

2.Focus on the Dominant Term
It retains the term with the highest growth rate.
eg. O(n²+n)->O(n²).

3.Drop Non-Dominant Terms
Retain only the highest term in combined complexities.
eg. O(n+n²+logn)->O(n²).

4.Consecutive Operations Add
Add complexities for sequential operations.
eg. O(n)+O(n)->O(n).

5.Multiplication for Nested Loops
Multiply complexities for nested loops.
eg. O(n×n)->O(n²).

6.Iterative Loops
Single loop: O(n); Nested loops: multiply complexities.
eg. O(n×n)->O(n²).
